    <h1>Band Name Generator</h1>
    <p>Type commands in the Python REPL below. This is all running in your browser!</p>

    <!--
      py-repl creates an interactive console.
      We'll just paste your code in here.
      When a user clicks "Run", it will ask for inputs and print results.
    -->
    <py-repl>
city = input("What is the city you were born in?\n")
pet = input("What is your pet's name?\n")
print(f"Your band name could be {city} {pet}")
    </py-repl>

    <!--
      Alternatively, if you want a button-based approach
      with HTML input fields, you'd do it differently.
      But let's keep it simple with a REPL.
